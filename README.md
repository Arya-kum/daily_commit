# GitHub Daily Commit Action

This project sets up a GitHub Action that automatically commits changes to the repository on a daily basis. The action is defined in the `.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml` file and is scheduled to run once per day at a specific time using cron syntax.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this GitHub Action is to ensure that the repository is updated regularly, which can be useful for various automation tasks, such as keeping track of changes, updating documentation, or simply ensuring that the repository remains active.

## Setup

1. **Create the Workflow**: The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml` file. Ensure that this file is present in your repository.

2. **Configure the Schedule**: The workflow uses a cron schedule to run daily. You can modify the schedule in the YAML file to suit your needs.

3. **Email Notification**: The workflow includes a step that references the email `23f2003681@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` in its name, which can be useful for tracking purposes.

4. **Update Tracking**: The `update.txt` file can be used to track changes that will be committed by the workflow. You can modify this file as needed, and the workflow will commit those changes automatically.

5. **Triggering the Action**: The action will run automatically based on the defined schedule. You can also manually trigger it if needed.

By following these steps, you can set up a daily commit action in your GitHub repository to keep it updated and active.
